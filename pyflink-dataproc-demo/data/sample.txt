Apache Flink is a framework and distributed processing engine for stateful computations over unbounded and bounded data streams.
Flink has been designed to run in all common cluster environments, perform computations at in-memory speed and at any scale.
PyFlink is the Python API for Apache Flink that allows you to build streaming applications in Python.
DataProc is Google Cloud's fully managed Apache Spark and Hadoop service.
With DataProc you can easily create clusters and run big data workloads.
Flink on DataProc provides a powerful combination for stream processing in the cloud.
This demo shows how to run PyFlink jobs on Google Cloud DataProc clusters.
Stream processing enables real-time analytics and event-driven applications.
Apache Flink provides low latency and high throughput for streaming data.
Google Cloud Storage provides scalable object storage for big data workloads.
